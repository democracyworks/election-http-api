    * It should be set to one of the following:
        * `[".+"]` to allow requests from any origin
        * an EDN seq of allowed origin strings
        * an EDN map containing the following keys and values
            * :allowed-origins - sequence of strings
            * :creds - true or false, indicates whether client is allowed to send credentials
            * :max-age - a long, indicates the number of seconds a client should cache the response from a preflight request
            * :methods - a string, indicates the accepted HTTP methods.  Defaults to "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, PATCH, OPTIONS"
    * For example: `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=["http://foo.example.com" "http://bar.example.com"]`

## Usage

To search for upcoming elections for 1 or more district divisions, send a GET
request to `/upcoming` with a query string of comma-separated OCD-IDs like this:

`?district-divisions=ocd-division/country:us/state:co/county:denver,ocd-division/country:us/state:co`

It will respond with the set of upcoming elections that someone registered in
one of those OCD-IDs can vote in or an empty set if none were found.

build script.

The `script/build` and `script/deploy` scripts are designed to
automate building and deploying to CoreOS.

1. Note the resulting image name and push it if needed.
1. Set your FLEETCTL_TUNNEL env var to a node of the CoreOS cluster
   you want to deploy to.
